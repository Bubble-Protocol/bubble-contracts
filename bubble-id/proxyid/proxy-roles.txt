Proposed v1.0 future standard
-----------------------------

Bits 224..255 (32-bits)   Application ID
Bits 0..223   (224-bits)  Role

Note: Admin can create new users and set roles so they must be all powerful.  Need to think about whether even 
      admin should be restricted from certain roles - e.g. don't want tech-admin of Privacy Regulator ID having 
      access to people's VCs.  Perhaps an admin Proxy ID could be setup to require multi-sig or could have
      different admin roles.  Possible for an organisation to create their own Persona contract with specific
      restrictions.
